## What is Bird Dog?

Bird Dog is a web-based navigator and translator for Ukrainian documents hosted on [WikiSource](https://uk.wikisource.org). It allows users to track and evaluate changes to Wiki page content and export spreadsheet updates for further downstream processing by the Ukranian Data Acquisition team at Jewish Gen.

### Getting Started

1. [Create a profile or log in](#create-profile-or-login)
3. [Add archives to your watchlist](#add-archives-to-your-watchlist) (Bird Dog will notify you of new documents as they appear.)

On your first visit, you need to create a profile by providing your name, email address, and password.

## Add Archives to your Watchlist

Your first step is to let Bird Dog know which Archives you want to monitor. Simply select the archive from the drop down. You also need to provide a cutoff date. Bird Dog will report any ongoing changes to the selected archive on or after the cutoff date. Click "Add" when you're ready. Bird Dog will take a few seconds to collect the page updates for you to review.
